August Ash code challenge

I approached this app almost as a MEAN stack application. The REST protocols were to interact with a third-party API, as opposed to a Mongo Database. I suppose that makes it an 3EAN stack application. I used Javascript, Angularjs, Nodejs, and Express.
For this project, the roadblocks were legion, but largely based around the API. Having had no experience with 3rd Party API REST protocol interaction, and about a half-day of Authentication Token experience, I quickly found myself underwater.
I was able to push past a few roadblocks, but I remain stuck. The auth token is able to be returned to me, from the initial call, but despite it working in CURL on the command line, I cannot get it to work correctly in the REST calls. I guess I'm just stumped.
Beyond that, I decided to write the remainder of the project 'blind,' as I'm not entirely sure that it will work without being able to actually build it. Some pseudo-code remains, but a good amount of actual code is there, awaiting the day where it is all plugged together.
